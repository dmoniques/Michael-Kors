Duplicating Michael Kors website

Copied MichaelKors.com

This is my first project. I wasn't able to do JS to 
make a scrolling effect. And I wasn't able to add icons
to the sign-in and store locator sections.

I learned after this project of organizing my CSS through something
called Object Oriented CSS.  I'll work on that on my next project.
